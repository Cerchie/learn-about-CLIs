# Learn About CLIs (Command Line Interfaces)!

## What is a [Command Line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)?

Well, it's an interface that provides a way for a developer to execute programs from commands.

In MacOS, you can do this from the [terminal app](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac).

In Windows, you can use [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/).

## How Do I Get Started Learning More About CLIs?

Once you know how to open your terminal, you can install npm by following the instructions on [this page](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Then, copy and paste `npm i -g learnclis` into your terminal and hit 'enter'. That command will download and install this CLI (which is an interactive tour of CLI basics -- commands, args, and flags) for you!

From there, enter `letsgo start` and follow the prompts to learn more about the basic components of a CLI.

I also plan to make it more compliant with [these CLI design guidelines](https://clig.dev/), for example, adding a `--no-color` flag,
